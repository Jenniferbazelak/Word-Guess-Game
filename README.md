Press any key to begin. The object of the game is to guess the letters of a word. If your guess is correct, you will see it appear on the screen by replacing the "_" with the correct letter guessed. If you guess incorrectly, your failed attempts are recorded in "letters already guessed." You can only guess incorrectly up to 8 times. After 8 failed attempts you will lose and you can try again. If you guess the word correctly, YOU WIN!
